## Instructions

To play the game click on two cards to reveal their symbols.  
If they match they will turn green and remain on the grid but if they don't match they will be hidden again after one second. Find all eight pairs to complete the game.
At the end your score will be revealed, to get three stars you need to complete in less than 20 moves and for two stars less than 40.
Press the rest button to play again.
